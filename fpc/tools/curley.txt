        DISASSEM.SEQ

          A 8086 disassembler.  This disassembler is patched into
        SEE, so all you have to do is type:

                SEE <a_code_word> <enter>

          You will see a line of Assembly code.  Continuing to press
        <enter> after each line shows additional instructions. Press
        ESC to terminate disassembly.

          You can also disassemble from an address:

                <addr> DISASSEM <enter>

          The disassembler displays Postfix notation ala F83.

        DIS8086.SEQ

          Donation from Bill Muench, is a modified version of
        Curley's DISASSEM.SEQ above, adjusted to disassemble in
        PREFIX mode.

          The disassembly can be sent to a file from either of the
        above files by using PFILE to specify a printfile, then
        typing:

                PFILE EXIT.SEQ <enter>
                PRINT SEE EXIT <enter>
                PCLOSE <enter>

          To disassemble EXIT to the file EXIT.SEQ.
