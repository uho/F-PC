        AUTOLOAD.SEQ                            by Tom Zimmer

          A simple utility to make F-PC load a file automatically at
        boot time. Add this to the system and resave the system.
        Place your forth commands in the file F-PC.CFG and they will
        be executed before F-PC handles the command line.

        AUTOFOR.SEQ                             by Tom Zimmer

          A completely automatic forward reference manager.

        BLINKER.SEQ     *** MOVED TO F-PC ***   by Tom Zimmer

          Adds words to enable/disable the blink attribute when background
        color 8 to 15 are used. Also provides words to read and set the
        border color and color palette.

        BLKTOSEQ.SEQ                            by Tom Zimmer

          This file contains the source for a utility to convert your
        .BLK files into .SEQ files.  Type the following to convert a
        file:

                FLOAD BLKTOSEQ <enter>
                CONV <enter>                    you will be prompted
                <file_to_convert> <enter>       for the filename to
                                                convert.

          The .BLK file will be converted to a sequential file, with
        the new extension .SEQ.  All extra blank lines will be
        omitted.  Shadow screens in .BLK files will be enclosed in
        DF's "Comment:" mechanism, and appended to each source block.
        If a BLOCK file does not have shadows, then change its
        extension to .SCR, and DF will convert all screens
        sequentially.

        BLOCK.SEQ                               by Tom Zimmer

          A new virtual block system for Forth.  This is my own
        implimentation, and it is very fast, and uses a true LRU
        buffer allocation mechanism.  You can also change the block
        size to be anything you want, as well as specify as many
        or as few block buffers as you can hold in memory.

        CODEBUG.SEQ                             by Tom Zimmer

          A simple assembly language debugger for F-PC. You might find
        this very useful when trying to debug your new CODE words. It
        doesn't have many functions, but it will allow you to set a
        breakpoint, and step through a CODE word watching the stack and
        registers.

        CODEHIGH.SEQ

          Utility to allow calling high level words from assembly (code)
        definitions.

        available on a color display. Useful when you are trying to pick
        color combinations for a program.

        COLPLAY.SEQ                             by Michael Schroeder

          Fancy color setup for F-PC, neat but needs too much memory to
        make if part of the system all the time.

        COMMAND.SEQ                             by Tom Zimmer

          A nestable comment line entry routine.  Can be placed in a
        program to allow entering Forth commands without fear of
        aborting the currently running Forth word.

        CONSTANT.SEQ                            by Tom Zimmer

          A utility to allow defining multiple constants and variables as
        follows:

                CONSTANTS       3 george        12 robert
                               14 betty         72 bongo    ;

                VARIABLES       Gort!           clatoo
                                borada          nicto       ;

          Note the ";" terminating the list of constants. If you use
        multiple lines, you can put "\" delimited comments on the same line
        as the constants or variables.

        DOSIO.SEQ                               by Tom Zimmer

          A conversion utility to allow F-PC to accept re-directed
        input and output from the DOS command line.  You can make
        filters that use all of the power of Forth.

        series of printers.

        LISTED.SEQ      suggested by J”rg Staben, re-written by Tom Zimmer

        Implements a function list, to which new functions can be added,
        or old functions removed. The list of functions can be executed,
        or displayed. Provides the functionality of DEFERS and UNDEFERS
        in a more general way.

        LOCALS.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

        An implimentation of local variables for F88, places then in a
        seperate stack for flexibility. Four locals are defined, LOCALA
        through LOCALD. A simple syntax is provided for allocating these
        variables, and deallocation is automatic at definition end.

        MIDNIGHT.SEQ                            by Peter Midnight

          A visual demo of the towers of hanoi problem and solution.
        Written by Peter Midnight as his single most significant claim
        to fame up to 1980. Since that time, Peter has done many more
        things, but claims no fame.

        MONITOR.SEQ

          An on screen editor, allows you to cursor up and change all
        the stuff on the screen, then re-enter it by pressing <enter>
        on a line. Neat stuff.

        MORE.SEQ                                by Tom Zimmer

          A set of words that will control the screen update rate of
        F-PC.  The words include a word PAGED to select way to wait for a
        key from the user after 100 calls to ?KEYPAUSE. SLOWER and FASTER
        insert a delay into ?KEYPAUSE, and can be called repeated to
        increase or decrease the delay.  NORMAL restores full speed
        screen performance.

        NEW-WFL.SEQ                             by a Russian engineer

          An improved version of my window file selection utility. This
        version is much nicer than mine, its only drawback is size, being
        around 12k of compiled code.

        NEWCOM.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

          A utility to allow the easy creation of VERY SMALL .COM

        Pictured numeric output for F-PC and TCOM. This file lets you
        specify a picture string to be used when converting a single or
        double number to a string in preperation for output. This can be
        very handy in an application where you want a number to look a
        certain way.

        PROFILE.SEQ                             by Tom Zimmer

        Provides a transparent way of profiling the colon definition
        performance of your large F-PC applications.

        Interrupt driven input support for RS232 communications ports 1
        and 2. Also polled output support. Mostely in CODE, so it works
        fine upto at least 19.2k baud. Also includes routines to install
        and remove the interrupt vectors as needed to prevent your
        computer from crashing after you leave F-PC.

        SELECT.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

        your programs a good user interface without having to go to a lot
        of work.

        SETJMP.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

        Adds a 'C' like SETJUMP capability to F-PC. Used in error
        handling, to abort operations while nested down many levels,
        without having to call ABORT. Cleans up the return and data stacks
        to where they were at the start of SETJMP.

        SCROLL.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

        Some simple code utilities to allow scrolling an area of the
        screen as specified by two pairs of x/y coordinates up or down
        one line.

        SEQTOBLK.SEQ                            by Tom Zimmer

        This file contains the source for a utility to convert your
        .SEQ files back to .SCR files.  Type the following to convert
        a file:

                FLOAD SEQTOBLK <enter>
                CONV <enter>                    you will be prompted
                <file_to_convert> <enter>       for the filename to
                                                convert.

        The .SEQ file will be converted to a BLOCK file, with the
        new extension .SCR.  Screen 0 will be blank.  The first line
        of each block will be blank, preceded by a "\".  The last
        line of each block will also be blank.  The resulting will
        be an exact multiple of 1024 bytes in length.  The resulting
        file will need to be substantially edited, to move entire
        definitions onto one screen, as they are likely to be split
        across screens in the move.

        SPREAD.SEQ                              by Craig Lindley

        A simple Forth spreadsheet, published in FORTH Dimensions Volume
        VII, 1 & 2.  This is a good tutorial on how spreadsheets work, the
        code is clear and easy to read.

        UNLINK.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

        A utility to search for and unlink a word from a defered word
        chain.

        UNREF.SEQ                               by Tom Zimmer

        Modified by Tom Zimmer to move a word from the CONTEXT vocabulary
        to the CURRENT vocabulary.

        WINDOW.SEQ

        A nice window package for Forth, Much assembly, so its very
        fast. Primarily useful in an application package. Try the
        demo. Again Zimmer did not write this, it was sent to him, and
        he modified it to work under F-PC.

        WYSE50.SEQ                              by Tom Zimmer

        A simple package to allow EMITted Wyse 50 terminal escape
        codes to be emulated on the IBM screen.  This has limited
        functionality, since only a few of the sequences are
        implemented.
