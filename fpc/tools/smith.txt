SMITH.SEQ       Documentation on utilities provided by Robert L. Smith.

         DMULDIV.SEQ

          A 64 bit by 32 bit mixed divide, with a 32 bit quotient and
        a 32 bit remainder result.  Also, a 32 bit by 32 bit
        multiply, yielding a 64 bit product (all unsigned).  Written
        by Robert L. Smith in 8086 assembly.

        FFLOAT.SEQ

          Software support for the 8087 floating point chip. This is
        Robert Smith's new Fast floating point interface to the hardware
        chip.

        SFLOAT.SEQ

          Software floating point package for those of us who don't have
        an 8087. It is compatable with the Forth Venders Group floating
        point standard. Several files are loaded by SFLOAT.SEQ.  This
        IS a COPYRIGHTed package, and may be used for your personal
        purposes only.  You may not sell it as part of any software
        package without the consent of Robert Smith.

        COMPLEX.SEQ

          Routines to assist in complex arithmetic.  Note particularly
        the complex division algorithm!

        FLTBUG.SEQ

          Provides additional support for hardware floating point
        information while using DEBUG or DBG .  The floating point
        stack may be displayed while debugging, along with the 80x87
        status and control word information.  Note that code level
        debugging (using CODEBUG.SEQ) now also supports floating
        point.
