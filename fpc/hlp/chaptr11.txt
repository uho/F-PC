HOW TO HANG F-PC WITHOUT A LONG ROPE


Instead of the usual ending of a book, telling you how wonderful F-PC is
(it is) and that with it you will live happily ever after (you will), let
us do something unusual.  Let us talk  about things that you can do to
crash this system.  This has the advantage that we can use a positive
tone, saying what you can do instead of warning you about things you
should not do.  It will give you much more insight into F-PC and let you
taste the power you gain over the computer and the operating system.

The question is: "How to hang your F-PC without a long rope?"  Here is a
short list to begin with. You will certainly find other ways to do it.
We welcome your input and suggestions to make this list complete.

1.      Use a short rope.

2.      Type " -1 @ ".  It will crash the AT system.  However, AT can
still be rebooted by Ctrl- Alt-Del.  It does not affect PC or XT.

3.      Type " -1 ! ".  It will crash the AT system for good.  You will
have to recycle power, if you don't have that hardware reset button on
your computer.

4.      Type " >R ".  It works every time.

5.      Store anything into your dictionary in the Code Segment.  You can
use !, but that's not bold enough.  Use ERASE, FILL, BLANK, or CMOVE.

6.      Store anything into the DOS area below the Code Segment.  It will
probably not affect F- PC.  However, wait until you say 'BYE'.  Ms. DOS
will lay the computer down flat.

7.      Store anything into the dictionary in the  Head Segment.  F-PC
will still say 'ok', but it will not recognized words you type in.  You
will get the 'What?' message.

8.      Store anything into the dictionary in the List Segment.

9.      Do a " 0 0 DO ... LOOP ".  If you have anything useful in this
loop, F-PC will spend a long, long time doing it for you.  You might just
as well assume the system crashed and do a reset. (You can do a warm
restart by pressing the Control-Break key.)

10.     In a code definition, use any of the SI, DS, ES, SS and CS
registers and not restore it before NEXT.

11.     Do a " JMP " in assembler.

12.     Implement your own hardware interrupt.

13.     Do multi-tasking.

14.     Build a large loop without balancing the stacks inside the loop.

15.     Print a binary file on your printer.  You may not totally crash
the computer, but a bucketful of paper shooting through the printer at 10
miles per hour is an impressive sight.

16.     Do a " TYPE " without parameters.  See 15.

17.     FORGET a part of the dictionary that contains a definition that
has been DEFERred to. When you next execute the deferred word, the system
will hang.

18.     FORGET a task in the round robin task chain.  The system will
work for a while until new definitions creep into the place where the
forgotten task was defined.

Now that you know how to crash F-PC, you may want to use it to do
something useful.


THE KITCHEN SINK


The last time we counted, F-PC contains 1800 regular words and 700
headless words.  It contains everything except the kitchen sink.  Well,
such omission is certainly not to be tolerated.  So, let us throw in the
kitchen sink as well to make it complete:

        : SINK ." A conduit to BBB, the great Big Bit Bucket." ;
        : KITCHEN ." See SINK" ;
        ' KITCHEN ALIAS KITCHEN-SINK

These words only cost us 100 bytes in memory with absolutely no run-time
penalty.  That is a very small price to pay for the potential claim of
system closure.  A petition will be sent forward to the ANS Forth
Standards Committee to include them in the coming Forth standard.

This joke was attributed to Allen Furman, the resident philosopher at the
Silicon Valley FIG Chapter.

AN INVITATION

Before parting, let us remind you that F-PC is an open system and
contributions from users like you are always welcome.  We think F-PC will
be a very useful vehicle for the MS-DOS segment of the Forth community to
exchange ideas and code, for as long as there are still PC/XT/AT
computers and their clones.  Join the Forth Interest Group local chapter
nearest you because there you will most likely find some people
knowledgeable about F-PC.  You can ask for the address and phone number
of the local chapters from the FIG central office, (408) 277-0668.  FIG
also sponsors a Forth Roundtable on the GEnie Network.  There are very
active discussions on F-PC on-line.  Dr. Jack Brown is running an on-line
F-PC tutorial.  Sysops of the Forth Roundtable are very helpful on
technical problems.  Here we include a list of local FIG chapters and a
list of the on-line resources, in case you want to find help in a chapter
near you or through on-line services.
