  The various "%" commands in the above lines are interpreted as follows:

        %1      Is replaced with the filename being edited
        %2      Is replaced with the ROW of the file being edited
        %3      Is replaced with the COLUMN of the file being edited
        %F      Is replaced witht he file being edited but with the file
                  extension removed
        %P      Is replaced with prompted command line parameters. %P can
                  be followed with an optional string upto a " character
                  in the form:  %PHello there"  where "Hello there" will
                  be the prompt rather than the default "Command line:"

  The purpose of the %P escape sequence is to allow user entered parameter
to be entered at command line execution time. The optional string following
lets the user know what kind of parameter is being requested. Multiple
%P sequences can be placed in a DOS command sequence, and each will be
prompted and filled in before ANY of the DOS commands in the sequence is
performed. The total length of any DOS sequence is limited to 255 characters,
including The expanded filename, and parameters.

  The "|" symbol is used to delimit DOS commands, with "||" being used to
signify the end of a series of commands. Text to the right of "||" is
treated as comments.
