  LOOK is a text search program, it will look for words or phrases in one or
more files in one or more directories.

LOOK can be used in any of the follows ways:

    LOOK mytext <enter>                search all (*.*) file in the
                                       current directory for "mytext".

    LOOK "my text" <enter>             search all (*.*) files in the
                                       current directory for "my text".

    LOOK 'my text' *.txt *.doc         search all .TXT and all .DOC files
                                       for "my text".

    LOOK !my text! *.txt>mytext.lst    search all .TXT files for "my text"
                                       and write the found list of occurances
                                       to the file MYTEXT.LST

    LOOK "my text" -g<dir> *.txt       GLOBAL search all .TXT files in <dir>
                                       and lower directories for "my text".

  If LOOK is entered on a line without any parameters, then it will prompt
for the string to search for, and the file specs to search.

  As can be seen in the examples above, the first "NON-ALPHANUMERIC"
character following the LOOK command will be used as the text string
delimiter character.

  A full DOS pathed filespec or specs can be used in any of the above
examples. Here are some typical filespecs:

        C:\UTILS\*.DOC   A:\*.TXT   C:\TC\INCLUDE\*.H

  LOOK scans files at the rate of about 40,000 bytes per second on a 8MHz
PC-AT class harddisk machine.

  You can pause LOOKing by pressing the space bar, or terminate with
the ESCape key.

  LOOK automatically breaks non-text files into 64 character lines, so it
can be used for searching Forth .BLK and .SCR files as well as text files.

  LOOK was written in Forth, and compiled with the TCOM optimizing
compiler on the F-PC Forth system using IBM-PC/AT compatible hardware. A
machine with at least 512k of memory and a harddisk is required. LOOK is
public domain, as is F-PC, and TCOM. To obtain the latest version of
