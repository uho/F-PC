116.    02/06/91        **** FPC Version 3.5500 *****
        Reworked FPC to use a new memory management mechanism. This version
        introduces the POINTER concept. A pointer is a word that returns a
        physical memory paragraph number (16bits) to the user when
        executed, after allocating the needed memory if it hasn't already
        been allocated. If a pointer fails to allocate the desired memory,
        then a zero (0) is returned indicating an out of memory condition.
        Pointers are defined as follows:

                <double_number_size_in_bytes> POINTER <pointer_name>

                1024. (a double number, note the ".") POINTER XYZ

        A small data structure is created to hold the pointer information.
        No space is actually allocated for the pointer until it is first
        used.

        memory allocated with pointers is appended to the memory FPC
        already uses in a "heap". Another word "UNPOINTER>" can be used to
        release the memory allocated to a pointer. It is sued as follows:

                : release_XYZ   ( -- )
                                UNPOINTER> XYZ ;

        UNPOINTER> can only be used in a definition. If you need to release
        a pointer interactively, use the sequence:

                ' XYZ %UNPOINTER <enter>

        Not pretty I admit, but normally this operation is done only while
        in a program.

        Several words have been added to FPC, to support the new memory
        management system, here is a list:

        #PARS           holds the number of paragraphs currently allocated.
        PHEAD           Variable that points to the head of the pointer
                        list.
        UD16/           Unsigned double number divide by 16.
        DPARAGRAPH      Convert the double number to a number of
                        paragraphs.
        SIZEOF!>        Set the size in double bytes of the POINTER
                        following.  Exmpl: <double_num> SIZEOF!> XYZ
        0POINTERS       System word that clears out all pointers. Don't
                        ever use this word in any of your programs.
        CMOVE-PARS
        CMOVE-PARS>     Move paragraphs of memory. See their source for
                        the syntax of how they are used.
        MAXBLOCK        Returns the maximum number of paragrahs that can be
                        allocated without getting an allocation error.

        All of FPC and TCOM have been modified to work with this new memory
        management system. I recommend you use it as well, rather than the
        old ALLOC and DEALLOC.

        Also added .VERSION to display the whole version number including
        the least digits.

117.    02/12/91        ***** Version 3.5501 *****
        Installed the code from POSTHEX.SEQ into KERNEL2.SEQ. This effects
        "%NUMBER". Now you can use sufixes of H to specify, Hex or B to
        specify Binary. This is in addition to  a $ prefix meaning HEX, and
        'letter' meaning ascii, and ^letter meaning CONTROL. Has no effect
        on your ability to define word names, but if you define a word that
        fits into any of the above catagories, then it will be a function
        rather than a number!

        Also added expanded memory support into the kernel. This is in
        preparation for later enhancements that I hope will move most of
        F-PC out of memory into expanded memory when performing a shell to
        DOS.

        Also added ".MEM" which tells you how your F-PC memory is being
        used along with the names of the pointers using the memory. The
        last line of .MEM tells how much DOS memory is still available.

118.    02/13/91
        Installed a new editor status line from John Peters. Editor status
        line now shows current and max values for line, column, page and
        lines. Very nice, thank you John.

        Added SELECT to the ZIMMER.ZIP file. SELECT.SEQ is an onscreen
        menu system. Provides automatic handling of many menu functions,
        and gives the user a good interface at the same time. TRY IT!

        Added LASERJET.SEQ as a loaded part of F-PC. So F-PC now supports
        either the IBM ProPrinter, or the HP LaserJet/DeskJet family of
        printers.

119.    02/20/91
        Enhanced .MEM to display the status of expanded memory as well as
        normal DOS type REAL memory.

        Fixed some bugs in MULTASK.SEQ, that was preventing the
        multi-tasking data structure from being relocatable. This was
        preventing any application that used multi-tasking from running
        properly unless it was reloaded into exactly the same memory space
        as it was first created. This was NOT GOOD. It is now fixed,
        although there was a small performance penalty due to a runtime
        conversion from absolute to relative and back again on each task
        switch.

120.    02/25/91               ***** Version 3.5502 *****

121.    02/27/91
        A new command 'S' under the Alt-O menu in the editor, allows
        editing of files containing TABs.  SED will expand the tabs on the
        display, and only expand the tabs in the file of those lines you
        change.

        Fixed SED so you can now edit .BAK file. When you select such a
        file, SED switches into NOBACKUP mode, and allows the file to be
        edited. If you make changes and save the file, then the changes are
        saved into the .BAK file.   The NOBACKUP mode has also been
        adjusted to not bother .BAK and .$$$ files when you are editing the
        primary source file. This is incase you are editing a primary file,
        and a >BAK file together, and making changes to one, then other or
        both.

122.    02/28/91        05/13/91 see also 139.
        Added a command to the editor, "Ctrl-]" that displays the current
        memory usage in the computer.

        F-PC now moves itself into EXPANDED memory when you shell out to
        DOS if there is enough expanded memory available. If there isn't,
        then is just shells out, and leaves itself in memory. The Expanded
        memory allocated is only allocated while you are shelling out, and
        is then deallocated upon return to F-PC.  The file EMMEXEC.SEQ and
        a modified version of EXEC.SEQ make this all possible.

123.    03/04/91
        Fixed a minor bug in ".FILES". It had an escape sequence in it to
        print 8 spaces followed by a dash ( \s8- ), unfortunately the \s
        escape sequence needs two digits following it, not one so 80 spaces
        were being displayed not 8. Corrected as ( \s08- ) to display 8
        spaces followed by a "-".

        While I'm at it, I might as well document the list of escape
        sequences available in "dot quotes":

        This utility allows the creation of special ." strings that contain
        imbedded escape sequences to select various display operations.

        The leading character is "\", followed by:

        0               Normal display attributes
        1 to 8          Attributes 1 through 8
        :xx             Delay xx tenths of a second
        <               Save the current cursor position     (not nestable)
        >               Restore the previous cursor position (not nestable)
        @xxyy           Move cursor to xx,yy
        B               Beep the speaker
        D               Dark (clear screen)
        N               Newline (CRLF)
        R               Select Reverse video
        Sxx             Display xx spaces
        T               Perform a Tab
        \               Display a \ character
        `               Display a " character
        |               Display a linefeed character

        The performance of this version of ." will be somewhat slower than
        a normal TYPE, as the string must be scanned for the "\" escape
        character.

124.    03/05/91
        Fixed the bug? in /STRING that was preventing it from extending the
        length of a string when fed a negative number.

        Added a variable USE-EMM, and words EMMON and EMMOFF to set it.
        The state of USE-EMM set to FALSE, will cause the word EMM-PRESENT?
        to return a false even if Expanded Memory is present.  EMMON is the
        default state of USE-EMM (TRUE).

        Added variable USE-DISK, and words DISKON and DISKOFF to set it.
        The state of USE-DISK set to FALSE, will cause F-PC NOT to flush
        itself to DISK when no Expanded memory is available. Setting it to
        DISKON will make F-PC flush itself to disk whenever a SYS command
        is performed.  Currently a file "FPCIMAGE.$$$" in the handle
        EXTHNDL is being created to hold the F-PC image during the shell.
        DISKOFF is the default state of USE-DISK (FALSE).  EXTHNDL can be
        filled with any "DRIVE:\PATH\FILENAME.EXT", to cause the FPC image
        to be written to any ramdisk or drive desired.  the default name
        will be used if no other file is specified.  Expanded memory is
        given preference over disk even if DISKON is used, so type EMMOFF
        and DISKON to force F-PC to save its image to disk.  On a real disk
        drive, this can take several seconds both for the save, and later
        for the recover.  This facility is primarily useful for those
        people that don't have expanded memory, but do have EXTENDED Memory
        that can be changed into a ramdisk.  For maximum performance, don't
        let F-PC save its image anywhere, use EMMOFF and DISKOFF (default).
        Note, a disk full error on image save will still cause F-PC to
        perform the shell to DOS, but F-PC will not save itself to disk.
        Also note that F-PC deletes the FPCIMAGE.$$$ file after the shell
        is performed and lastly, FPCIMAGE.$$$ can be almost as large as
        your computers memory (greater than 500k), so be sure you have a
        lot of memory on you EXTHNDL file drive before using DISKON, or
        you will use time and gain no benefit.

125.    03/06/91
        Added "SWAPFILE" which is followed by a name, and sets the disk
        swapfile drive and name. DISKON is also performed, to cause F-PC to
        swap to disk when a shell is performed.

        Added ">HANDLE to take an a1,n1 string rather than a counted string
        and move it into the specified handle.

126.    03/07/91
        Added words to ZIMMER.ZIP to control blinking background colors,
        and to read and set the border colors. *** MOVED INTO F-PC ***

127.    03/13/91          ***** Version 3.5503 *****
        Added UBETWEEN and -SKIP to F-PC.

128.    03/15/91
        Added DOBORDER to <REEDIT> in SEDIT2.SEQ, to assure that a border
        would be shown even if the user types commands while the editor is
        loading the current file.

129.    03/30/91
        Integrated the new mouse driver from Mike Christopher.  there is
        now a cursor for the mouse, and another one for F-PC.

130.    04/05/91
        Located and removed all references to things like "1 -1 d+" which
        were used to shorted an address and length on the stack. Changed
        all of these occurances to the equivelant "1 /string" which doesn't
        have the carry problem from the count to the address if an
        underflow occurs.

131.    04/08/91
        Moved the file BLINKER.SEQ from the TOOLS directory, into the SRC
        directory, and now load it as a normal part of F-PC.  This adds the
        words BLINKON, BLINKOFF, BLINK!, PAL!, BORDER@ and BORDER!.

132.    04/10/91          ***** Version 3.5504 *****
        Fixed a bug in DOBORDER, that was keeping it from displaying the
        corner symbol at the upper right of the screen.

        At the recomendation of Jerry Boutelle, I have added watch point
        support to the debugger. This allows a 16 byte area ofCODE memory
        to be monitored between each step of the debugger. It can be very
        handy for watching HERE. The "W" command in the debugger, brings up
        a watch set command line, so you can type in an address that will
        be watched. If you type a word that returns an address, then that
        address will be watched. If you want to watch a word that doesn't
        return an address, enter it as " 'WORD " (without the "s ), and the
        CFA will be the watch address.

133.    04/12/91
        Added for Mike Mayo, a new variable, and three instructions to
        WORD. The variable is called ">IN_WORD", and it is set by WORD to
        be the line offset in TIB of the most recent word parsed out with
        WORD.  For example is you did a WORD on the first word in this
        line, then >IN_WORD would contain an 8.  This is useful for
        building index files, that want to know exactly where in the source
        file a particular word came from.  The performance penalty is
        insignificant.

134.    04/23/91        ***** Version 3.5505 *****
        Added LISTSET to the F-PC dictionary, it allows the user to adjust
        the amount of dictionary space desired, as the number of paragraphs
        of free space F-PC should retain on the next startup. The value
        #LISTSEGS is adjusted, and the memory image is resaved to the same
        name as the currently executing file.

        Correction to the mouse driver, it seems Mike Christopher modified
        the OLD MOUSE.SEQ file, not the current one, so when I included his
        new file, it had the OLD mouse bug in it. Fixed so the mouse
        doesn't show up unless you move the mouse the first time.

        Changed the file COLOR.SEQ, to allow the user to more easily modify
        the colros F-PC uses.  F-PC now uses an array called COLORS, which
        contains eight sets of background and forground colors for
        ">ATTRIB1" through ">ATTRIB8". The new words BG@, BG!, FG@ and FG!
        allow setting the colors in the array to control the colors F-PC
        will use.  See the file COLOR.SEQ for more details.

135.    04/30/91
        Fixed a bug in the word TBUF.INIT in EDITSTUF.SEQ. It was
        de-allocating the file selection tools buffer, and shouldn't have
        been.

        Also fixed the tool FUNKEY.SEQ so it will now load.  It contained
        an old example that didn't work, which has been replaced with a new
        example.

136.    05/06/91
        Added a VALUE "?PTRANS". ?PTRANS enables or disables embeded
        printer code translation.  Using TELETYPE will disable recognition
        of embeded %B, %U, %1.. %3 control codes. PROPRINT, or LASERJET
        both enable print control code recognition.

        Also added a marker at the upper left of the editor screen, that
        displays 'c' for a change has been made to the current file being
        edited, and 'u' for changed have been updated to the disk temp
        .$$$ file with Ctrl-U.  Final changes as always don't get written
        to disk unless you do an F10 edit, or an Alt-F1 rotate to another
        file.

        Added MAKEDEFER, a word to convert : (colon) definitions into
        defered words.  Used as follows:

                MAKEDEFER <colon_def_name> <new_def_name>

        The existing function of <colon_def_name> is transfered to the
        newly created <new_def_name>, and <colon_def_name> is converted
        into a DEFERed word which has the function <new_def_name>.

        As part of the above changes, I also added SWITCH.  SWITCH
        exchanges the bodies of the two words following. Used as follows:

                SWITCH NAME1 NAME2

137.    05/08/91        ***** Version 3.5506 *****
        Added some additional error checking code to local labels. It was
        possible before for an infinite loop condition to exist, if >RESL
        was trying to resolve a label, that never got layed down in memory
        properly.  Also added "ERR which outputs the error message. It is
        now possible to change the function of "ERR and have the message
        displayed without causing the compiler to abort.

        Made minor modifications to MACROS.SEQ.  You can now cancel a
        macro or (Alt-R) repeated key function by pressing ESC while the
        macro is being performed, or while a key is being repeated.  If
        you type in a large number for the number of times to repeat a
        key, and you didn't intend to, then you can press Alt-R again at
        the end instead of pressing the key to repeat, and the repeat will
        be canceled.

138.    05/11/91
        I have received a couple of comlaints about Alt-F7 (the paragraph
        line sort in the editor) being too easy to hit by accident. Added
        a prompt window that requires you to press 'Y' if you really want
        to sort the paragraph, any other key cancels.

139.    05/13/91
        Changed memory display command from "Ctrl-\" to "Ctrl-]". Also
        modified message 122 above to reflect "Ctrl-]".  Defined "Ctrl-\"
        to search for the nearest '\' character. useful for going to the
        comments of a line.  "Shift-Ctrl-\" moved to column 48 so you can
        start a new command.

        Added a new file UNLINK.SEQ to ZIMMER.ZIP.  The word UNLINK,
        searches for and removes a word from an defered word chain.

140.    05/14/91        ***** F-PC Version 1.5600 *****
        Added a new BEHEAD mechanism, in the form of UNHEAD.SEQ. Removed
        BEHEAD.SEQ the old mechanism.  UNHEAD is used like BEHEAD except
        it is not sensitive to vocabulary changes between the  HEADERS
        and HEADERLESS operations.  The words you use are in fact the
        same, BUT now there is only one "BEHEAD" at the end of the
        compile, just before the SAVE-EXE is performed.  F-PC still ships
        in the default mode which is HWORDS-, which causes all headerless
        words to keep their headers.  Also added a new word "I:" that is
        used in place of ":" to define a word that is "internal" and
        headerless.  System words UNTHREAD, UNVOC, and UNHEAD have also
        been added to support the new BEHEAD mechanism.

        FSAVE & SAVE-EXE have been modified so they will perform a BEHEAD
        before saving the memory image to disk.

        While working with Jerry Boutelle on the new SAM8 TCOM compiler,
        we found the local label mechaism to be too limited in design to
        handle all of the types resolve functions needed for the SAM8.
        Sooo, Jerry and I have completely redesigned the local label
        mechanism in F-PC to be like the local labels Jerry used in his
        Nautilus cross compiler. The file NEWLAB.SEQ loaded after PASM.SEQ
        now contains the generalized tools needed to resolve forward
        references of any type. A defered word RESOLVE_REF allows a
        linkage into the assembler to resolve forward references of
        varying types. As a new assembler is added to TCOM for example,
        the new assembler will link into this word, and provide the
        forward reference resolution functions needed. This will happen if
        a new type is required, like a 12bit address, or a 5bit data field
        or other type.

142.    05/20/91
        Removed one of the HIDE.MS functions from INITMOUSE, it seems some
        mouse drivers nest hide mouse functions, and thus it was not
        possible to ever make the mouse visible on those computers.  The
        mouse is supposed to be hidden on startup, and become visible when
        the mouse is first moved.

        Adjusted LISTSET so it doesn't actually perform the save if F-PC
        if the #LISTSEGS size requested is EQUAL to the size already
        selected.

143.    05/28/91
        Added an option to the printing menu to disable header and footer
        printing. The default is YES.  If you select NO, then no header or
        footer or page number is printed.

144.    05/31/91
        Added the words "IC, CC, O, OC," to PASM.SEQ, and installed their
        usage into PASM. These words allow TCOM to know when the assembler
        is assembling the first byte of an instruction (IC,), the first
        byte of a CALL (CC,), and any other byte or word (O, OC,) in an
        instruction.  This functionality is useful for TCOM when it makes
        an index of the code being compiled which will later be used to do
        a disassembly to source. Normally they are just defered to the
        assemblers "C," and "," words.

145.    06/12/91
        Received a call from Mike Christopher, with this series of bug
        fixes.

        1. Added MARK-CLEAR after the BEGIN in "<RED>". This clears
           marking mode when switching between files.
        2. Added "WINOFF +" to MOVE>MOUSE, this corrects the mouse cursor
           positioning when the window is scrolled right some distance.
        3. NASTY BUG in HCRITICA.SEQ In the word CRITINT, the INC
           instruction to HADCRITICAL needs to be forced to use CS: rather
           than the default DS:. This would cause a FOR SURE crash if F-PC
           was running when a critical error occured.

                LABEL CRITINT
                        STI
                        INC CS: HADCRITICAL WORD
                        MOV AL, # 0
                        IRET
                        END-CODE

146.    07/02/91                3.5600
        Modification to PASM.SEQ. Added the word ISETUP! and the VALUE
        ASM->IN. ASM->IN is set by ISETUP! to contain the line offset of
        the instruction being assembled. This is useful when building
        index records for TCOM. The new word ISETUP! replaces the previous
        sequence "A;! A;" in each instruction defining word, and adds the
        code to set ASM->IN so the assembler may have actually gotten
        smaller.

147.    07/11/91
        Corrected a minor bug in SEDSHELL.SEQ. An error message whas
        supposed to display 9 spaces, but was entered \s9 instead of
        \s09, causing a LARGE number of spaces to be displayed improperly.

148.    07/18/91
        Modified OVERLAY.SEQ to make it compatible with the new BEHEAD
        mechanism Implemented a while back.

149.    07/23/91        ***** F-PC Version 3.5601 *****
        Modified the mouse driver, to force the mouse to the upper left
        corner of the screen at F-PC's startup.  Some people (including
        myself) found it irritating to have the mouse popup in the middle
        of the screen.

        Made some enhancements to the SELECT.SEQ menu program for mouse
        operation. Added a Close button at a menus upper left, and added
        support for the scroll arrows and the Home/End buttons.

150.    08/06/91        ***** F-PC Version 3.5602 *****
        Minor bug fix to "FPC>OUT", to allow it to automatically try to
        use DISK save of F-PC when EMM is enabled, but not available.  Now
        applicatons can do a EMMON and a DISKON, and F-PC will use EMM if
        available, and DISK if it isn't.

151.    08/07/91
        Fixed a bug in VFIND. Robert Smith, reported it didn't work, and
        in fact it was missing a "HERE". Fixed.

152.    08/08/91        ***** F-PC version 1.5603 *****
        Added PLACEL and +PLACEL to KERNEL3.SEQ. These are quite useful
        when working with data in "OUTER SPACE!".

153.    09/13/91        ***** F-PC version 3.5604 *****
        Added EMM-POINTER to allow creating far POINTER type arrays in
        expanded memory.  These buffers are automatically allocated as
        they are used, and deallocated on exit from F-PC. Since expanded
        memory is only released explicetly by the users program, or by a
        reboot of the computer, it is important that BYEFUNC be performed
        before leaving F-PC to make sure the expanded memory is released.
        EMM-POINTER is used as follows:

                48152. EMM-POINTER <seg-name>

        When <seg-name> is later used, the requested space is allocated
        the first time. After that the space is simply mapped into the
        Expanded memory page frame buffer if required. The number of bytes
        that can be allocated by EMM-POINTER is always adjusted to a whole
        expanded memory page (16k), and is limited to four (4) pages (64k)
        by the size of the pageframe. There is little pointe in using
        EMM-POINTER to create a buffer smaller than 16k since that is the
        minimum allocatable size.

154.    10/02/91
        Corrected a bug in the decompiler for Bob Smith! The word .PFA was
        supposed to scroll the screen in a "many lined" definition, so the
        current word being debugged in the current definition was always
        visible.  To make along story short, it didn't work properly, and
        it does now.

155.    10/03/91        ***** F-PC version 3.5605 *****
        Corrected the definitions of +TAB & -TAB to use TABSIZE as they
        should. Removed the forced set of TABSIZE to 8 in .PFA.  You can
        now set TABSIZE outside of the debugger, and it will use whatever
        TABSIZE you set. Added 0TAB as a compliment to +TAB and -TAB, it
        resets LMARGIN to zero.

156.    11/04/91
        Corrected a long standing bug in the word "SEARCH", that was doing
        an improper case conversion for "performance reasons". It is now
        doing a conversion using ATBL the F-PC case conversion table.

        Changed F6 search in the editor so it performs a case sensitive
        search if CAPSLOCK is on, otherwise it performs a case INSENSITIVE
        search.

157.    11/06/91
        Fixed a bug in the editor search routine, it was searching lines
        from the line count byte, and simetimes matching a single
        character search to the line length byte. Changed to search from
        the first character of a line after the count byte.

        Also changed the statusline update during search to properly
        display the current search line and lastline.

158.    11/15/91
        Minor change to "<#IF>", allows it to ignore everything on a line
        after a "\". This will be faster, and also allows words like #ELSE
        and #THEN to occur between #IF and #THEN as long as they are in
        the comment area of a line (after the "\").

159.    12/18/91
        Fixed a long standing though minor bug in $FLOAD. If an open
        error were to occur in an FLOAD while already loading, then the
        open error would often show the line following the line where the
        error occured, rather than the correct source line. This was
        caused by $FLOAD not saving and restoring FILEPOINTER in the case
        where there was an open error. In fact it needed to save
        FILEPOINTER and restore it always. FIXED

        Fixed -TAB, to limit the value of TABSIZE to a positive number.

        Added PICTURE.SEQ to the ZIMMER.ZIP archive. It allows simple
        pictured numeric output.

160.    12/31/91        ***** F-PC version 3.5606 *****
        Received a request from Andreas Goyke for the ability to enter
        the european eumlated characters. He specifically requested the
        characters Ñ, Å, î, é, ö, ô, · and . These I have provided in
        F-PC and NEWZ, as an extention to the Alt-O-A (any character)
        graphics character box. You simply press A, U, O, or B, shifted
        or unshifted to enter the respective character.  Unfortunately I
        don't know if this is a complete set, but it is a start. I can
        always extend the set later.

161.    01/07/92
        Found a bug, recent changes to FPATH, removed a section of code
        that restores the current directories path to the file being
        opened, if the file can't be opened in any of the directories we
        search in FPATH.  This code was needed, in the case where the file
        was immediately created, so we would create the file in the
        current directory rather than in the last directory in the FPATH
        list. FIXED.

162.    01/08/92
        Added a pagination switch to the editor, to allow printing a
        document without paging. This was needed in the Z editor, which
        used the same PRINTING.SEQ file as F-PC.

163.    01/14/92
        Modified the graphic insert window to allow manually entering any
        control character just by pressing the CTRL key and a letter key
        while the graphic character box is on the screen.

164.    01/17/92        ***** F-PC version 3.5607 *****
        Minor mod to SOUND.SEQ.  Added NOTE, to generate sounds like TONE,
        but with a milli-second units, rather than 100-milli-second units
        like TONE. This change was actually suggested by "jb" on 4/9/89 as
        extracted from MISC_IBM.BLK in the F83 collection. I extracted
        this from a file called SOUND01.SEQ, and include it with the
        small change that the parameters are in the same order as TONE
        ( frequency length -- ), rather than as found in SOUND01.SEQ.

165.    01/25/92        Free distribution to SV-FIG

166.    01/26/92
        Made a small change in SEDCASE.SEQ to "paste_datetime", to remove
        the seconds and hundreds. Suggested by J. McKnight.

        Also added some comments to MULTASK.SEQ and clarified the example
        again per suggestions from J. McKnight.

167.    01/27/92
        Added UNREF.SEQ to ZIMMER.ZIP. provides an easy way to locate
        words in a large application that are not referenced in the
        application (dead code).

168.    02/03/92 13:40 tjz
        Modified WFL.SEQ so the file selection window will always display
        the directories of the current directory even if the file
        specification is changed from "*.*". Directories are extracted in
        a separate directory read pass, and are shown first in the file
        list. Directories are sorted, then filenames are sorted
        seperately.

169.    02/10/92 10:57 tjz   *** Version 3.5608 ***
        Changed the default values of #OVSEGS and #OVBYTES to zero, to
        signify no overlay support is currently loaded.

170.    02/18/92 15:00 tjz
        Changed FINDFIRST and FINDNEXT to be code words and renamed them
        to FIND-FIRST and FIND-NEXT. FIND-FIRST also accepts a mask byte
        for the types of files to include in the matching files. Used in
        few places, but since the stack picture changed, I have changed
        the word names.

171.    02/26/92 12:53 tjz
        Added Alt-9 to insert the standard Forth parameter stack picture
        "( -- ) \ ". This was requested by Jack Irwin.

        Also modified the TOOLS directory file OVERLAY.SEQ to add the
        function ENTRYNAME, that allows words in the overlay to be
        available externally with a different name than in the overlay.
        This is useful incase you want to use the same name in several
        different (but similar) overlays and have them available
        externally with different names.

172.    03/23/92 16:37 tjz
        Corrected the bug in "?DEF.EXT" that was causing it to think there
        was already a file extension in a file and path that contained a
        decimal point as part of the path but not the filename itself.
        Thank you Arndt.

173.    04/01/92 10:25 tjz
        Corrected some bugs in the editor, that would allow a search
        string longer than the search buffer to overwrite code beyond the
        end of the buffer, causing a crash.  *** FIXED ***

174.    04/09/92 14:45 tjz   *** Version 3.5609 ***
        Apparently some recent changes introduced a condition where PAD
        was being overused.  That is two functions were overwriting each
        others data in PAD. I have modified the window file selection
        mechanism to not use PAD, instead to use its own buffer. This
        costs some space, but fixes the problem. PAD is one of the most
        easily misused buffers in Forth, being always there, and
        unfortunately also being used my many people.

175.    04/21/92 12:15 tjz
        Modified NEWLAB.SEQ to report an error is a local label that is
        already being used, is defined again.

176.    04/22/92 13:23 tjz
        Modified PASM.SEQ to use the "ERR function rather than using
        ABORT", so TCOM can redirect error messages to the listing file,
        and avoid an immediate abort.

177.    05/15/92 08:24 tjz
        At the request of Jerry Boutelle, I have modified the POINTER
        functions to improve its performance by adding a code word to
        minimize the execution time of pointer defined words that have
        already allocated their space.  They are now about three times
        faster than they were before although this improvement will be
        swamped by other factors in most cases.

178.    07/17/92 15:30 tjz  *** Version 3.5610 ***
        Moved DEBUG.SEQ, DECOM.SEQ, COLOR.SEQ and WATCHER.SEQ from the
        F-PC experimental version into this mainstream version of F-PC.

        This provides some enhanced features to the debugger such as an
        adjustable split line on the screen, and an expandable watch
        area.

179.    07/21/92 10:15 tjz
        BUG fix, HELP was broken because I changes to using PLACE a while
        back and forgot that a blank needed to be appended to the string
        placed in HELPBUF for the help function to work.

180.    08/05/92 11:03 tjz
        Modified "SQUT", to not perform the PUT to the .$$$ file when you
        lt-press Alt-F10, unless there have been some changes to save.
        This saves some time, in the case where fyou have just been
        browsing a file, and didn't make or want to make any changes to
        the file.

181.    08/20/92 12:40 tjz      *** Version 3.5611 **
        Andreas Zilker informed me of a bug in the assembler.  It seems
        that if you use a MUL instruction without following it with an
        addressing mode, then a stack underflow will occur This happens
        because the assembler defaults to direct addressing unless
        otherwise specified.  While a stack underflow in itself is not
        really an assembler bug, the Forth system would then try to
        abort and display the word at here, which was garbage since the
        instruction had already assembled on top of it.  I have solved
        this problem, by adding code to detect when a stack underflow
        occurs during assembly.   An error message is issued, after
        clearing HERE to a null string.

182.    08/28/92 14:54 tjz
        I was reading an article in the latest "EMBEDED SYSTEM
        PROGRAMMING", and ran across an article by Steve Jones on 80x86
        assembly language.  He described a methode of improving the
        performance of string move operators by using MOVSW, without using
        conditional branch instructions to test for the ODD transfer case.
        I have implemented his technique in F-PC after performing some
        tests that indicate a doubling of CMOVE performance in a 386 class
        machine.  I suppose this was to be expected, but it was so easy,
        that I am very pleased.

        Here is the new instruction sequence:

                SHR CX, # 1
                REPNZ           MOVSW
                RCL CX, # 1
                REPNZ           MOVSB

        Which replaces this old instruction sequence:

                REPNZ           MOVSB

        There are about ten places in F-PC where MOVSB was used, all have
        been changed expect the reverse direction moves, which didn't work
        for as yet unknown reasons.

183.    09/02/92 12:52 tjz
        It turns out that the above simple change doesn't actually work
        in all cases. It in fact doesn't work in the case where you use
        CMOVE to move a string overlapping itself one byte, or the case
        where you are trying to use CMOVE to perform a FILL.

        Robert Smith and myself haved worked out a partial solution, that
        resolves the case where CMOVE needs to move an averlapping string
        one byte.  This more complex implementation also improves the
        performance of CMOVE in the case where you are moving bytes to an
        odd address, which the original change didn't improve.

        Here then is the code added to CMOVE.

                        TEST DI, # 1
                        JZ 0 $
                        JCXZ 0 $
                        MOVSB
                        DEC CX
                0 $:    SHR CX, # 1
                        REPNZ MOVSW
                        RCL CX, # 1
                        REPNZ MOVSB     \ this line already in CMOVE

        The only case that is still a problem, is the case where CMOVE is
        being used to perform a FILL.  This shouldn't be too much of a
        problem though, since FILL is defined in F-PC, and is faster than
        the old CMOVE fill anyway.

        By the way, all the above applies to CMOVEL as well as CMOVE.

184.    09/22/92 13:54 tjz
        Added release date verification to F-PC.

185.    10/21/92 11:04 tjz

186.    10/27/92 18:13 tjz
        Robert Patton notified me of a bug in the Z editor. When an Alt-W
        is done to a floppy drive that doesn't have a floppy in it, then
        an error condition occurs which is handled properly, but since the
        editor normally has autosave of changes turned on, then it later
        tries to save the changes back to the nonexistent drive, and
        crashes back to DOS.  This was actually a bug in F-PC that was
        effecting the Z editor.  FIXED

        Added a new utility file MORE.SEQ to the ZIMMER.ZIP file in the
        \FPC\TOOLS  directory.  This file implements two methods of F-PC
        screen display rate control.  See MORE.SEQ for additional
        information on usage.

        Bob and Steve reported a bug in my validate codeing, it was not
        calculating the year passage properly. Corrected! I hope.

        Robert Smith updated FDIS to use prefix notation for its output,
        rather than postfix as it used to use. The old FDIS.SEQ has been
        renamed to FDISASEM.SEQ and a new file FDIS86.SEQ has been added
        to CURLEY.ZIP.  Robert also updated CODEBUG.SEQ to support
        floading point debugging with FFLOAT.  Robert wrote FLTBUG.SEQ to
        provide some enhancements to the current F-PC debugger. Robert
        has also updated FFLOAT to fix some bugs, and to enhance its
        features and compatibility with SFLOAT.

190.    11/04/92 11:52 tjz & rls    ****** Version 3.5613 *******
        Made a few modifications to the debugger and decompiler. The
        decompiler now has a VALUE called SHOWBASE.  When SHOWBASE has a
        value other than zero (in the range 2 to 26), it causes the
        decompiler to display numbers during decompiling in the base
        specified by the number in SHOWBASE.   Also added two commands to
        the debugger.  'H' switches the debugger between displaying
        numbers in HEX and displaying in the current value of BASE.  A
        second command 'R' displays the contents of the return stack.

        A primitive word 'H.4' has been added to UTILS.SEQ, to support the
        above changes.  H.4 displays a number as exactly four hex digits.

191.    11/09/92 09:15 tjz & rls
        Bob found a bug in the return stack display word in the debugger.
        FIXED

192.    11/18/92 16:42 tjz
        Modified MACROS.SEQ, to add a toggleable delay function 'D', that
        inserts a 100 millisecond delay in between each macro key.  Also
        fixed the long standing bug in macros that complained if only a
        single key was put in a macro.  FIXED

193.    11/23/92 09:14 tjz ************ VALIDATE BUG **************
        Found a bug in the VALIDATE routine, it was not copying enough
        lines from the original validate file through to the user version
        of the file.  Corrected, and updated the copy method to be less
        sensitive to revisions.

194.    12/01/92 14:43 tjz rep          F-PC Verion 3.5614
        Robert Patton found a bug in the word <FLOAD>, associated with
        setting the variable that is created at file load time to allow
        viewing to work properly.  It seems that if you use the word
        EMPTY in a file that is being loaded, it forgets the file
        variable, leaving <FLOAD> no valid place to store its view
        results into.  This has been fixed by having <FLOAD> test to see
        that a variable does in fact exist in the right location, after
        the load is performed, before trying to store view results into
        the variable.  FIXED

195.    12/11/92 13:48 tjz
        A user reported that some of the example programs in SAMPLES.ZIP
        provided with F-PC don't work with the current release of F-PC.
        I have checked this out, and did find some problems.  FIXED

196     12/11/92 18:13 tjz
        Modified NEWLAB.SEQ in F-PC to allow nesting local label sets
        upto eight levels deep.  New words LLSET+ and LLSET- move up and
        down the local label set words.  This is primarily useful in the
        condition where you want to use a macro inside a code word, or
        another macro, and you use local labels in the macro.  The
        nesting prevents local label conflicts from occuring between
        unrelated code or macro words.

197     12/17/92 15:54 tjz
        Actually found a bug in PASM.  It seems it was issuing an error
        when you try to add a word value to memory without explicitly
        specifying WORD, as in the following:

                ADC     BINGO # $1234           \ wouldn't work
                ADC     BINGO # $1234 WORD      \ worked

        PASM has been corrected to allow the first form without having
        to specify WORD.

198     01/07/93 13:34 tjz
        Updated BOXTEXT.SEQ, to use a single string that holds the
        graphic characters that are used to surround the box that it
        draws.  This is more flexible, smaller, cleaner and faster.

199     01/08/93 07:36 tjz
        Repaired a bug in MACROS.SEQ.  It was terminating macro execution
        after the first key in a two key macro.  Also added a value
        MDELAY_VAL, which defaults to 1, for the delayed macro function
        "Alt-M D".  One being 1 tenth of a second.

200     01/20/93 12:47 tjz
        Found and fixed a bug in SEARCH that was preventing it from
        working on searches longer than 32k.

201     01/21/93 13:34 tjz
        Found that the above fix had a side effect, in that a long search
        was being performed if the string being searched is shorter than
        the string being searched for.  Corrected by adding an test at
        the beginning of search for this condition.

202     01/26/93 09:59 tjz
        Found a code imcompatibility between the current version of CMOVEL
        and the older version of CMOVEL that wasn't optimized to move
        words instead of bytes.  I have commented out the lines in CMOVEL
        that perform the optimization.

203     02/02/93 16:00 tjz
        Found yet another bug in the SEARCH routine, if the string being
        searched was exactly 1 character long, then a wrap around
        condition would occur, making SEARCH look beyond its allowed
        search area.  FIXED

204     03/15/93 15:03 tjz
        Added ?UPPERCASE to the file WATCHER.SEQ.  It needed to convert a
        user entered string to uppercase before doing number conversion on
        it.

205     03/26/93 15:27 rls
        Fixed bugs in FASINH and FACOSH.

206     04/01/93 14:19 tjz
        Modified "HEADER in KERNEL2.SEQ to be a defered word.  "HEADER is
        used by several words to create their headers instead of HEADER.
        This was causing problems for TCOM, becuase it needed to change
        globally how headers were being defined in UNHEAD.SEQ.  UNHEAD.SEQ
        has been gerneralized to change "HEADER instead of HEADER, and a
        new word "|" (vertical bar) has been added to allow specifying
        any immediately following defining word is to create a headerless
        word instead of a normal dictionary word.

207     04/30/93 11:58 ak & tjz
        Arndt Klingelnburg found that F-PC will crash when running CODEBUG
        to debug words that XCHG the data and return stack if you use ESC
        to drop out of the debugger when the stacks are exchanged.  He
        fixed this in his version, and I have addopted his change to
        CODEBUG.SEQ.

208     05/14/93 14:14 tjz
        Factored <FPATH+> in the file FPATH.SEQ into a new word called
        "FPATH+ that makes it easy to append a path to the current F-PC
        file search path while in a program.

209     05/17/93 14:54 tjz
        Added simple split windowing.  When more than one file is open,
        you can split the screen into two parts with "Alt-S S". Also
        appears under the Advanced menu.  The split point defaults to
        half a screen, but can be adjusted using "Alt-S W" (window
        adjust).  Automatically switches back to full window when only
        one file is open.

210     05/20/93 10:59 tjz & mm
        Mike Mayo wrote a very nice modified version of XEXPECT, that
        pops up a window and displays the command line stack.  I have
        made a few modifications to make it more compatible with the old
        XEXPECT, and included it into F-PC.  The old file XEXPECT.SEQ is
        still included in the zip FPCSRC.ZIP, but is not currently being
        loaded.  You can modify F-PC.SEQ to fload XEXPECT.SEQ instead of
        NEXPECT.SEQ and re-EXTEND F-PC is you want to restore the old
        version of EXPECT.

212     04/05/94 15:42 tjz
        Received some very useful utilities from Jorg Staben.
        Specifically he sent a tiny utility written by Michael Schroeder
        of Oschersleben Germany, that saves specifiable areas of data in
        F-PC or an application to something called a session file.  A
        session file gets automatically reloaded when you nest startup, so
        for example the colors which are part of the session file will be
        saved and restored if changed during an F-PC working session.
        Also included in the set of saved items is the recallable
        commandline arguments.  It is also very easy to add others.  See
        the file SVSESDAT.SEQ in the \FPC\SRC directory for further
        infoabout this.  I have also included a pair of files XMS.SEQ and
        XMS.HLP that provide (you guessed if) XMS memory support.

213     07/16/94 09:40 tjz
        Fixed a bug in the editor that was causing the last line of a file
        to be lost when shelling from the editor to DOS unless the last
        line was already empty.

        ********** FINAL RELEASE OF F-PC BY TOM ZIMMER ************
        This is the last release of F-PC by Tom Zimmer.  You might want to
        know either why I am doing this one more release, or why I am
        stopping with this release.  The reason for the first question is
        simple. Robert Smith gave me one more update on a floating point
        file, and so I am releasing it in this update.  The answer to the
        second question is also simple.  I am now working on a new Forth
        that runs on Window 3.1 with the Win32S extentions, Windows 95,
        and Windows NT.  This new Forth runs in a linear 32-bit address
        space, and  is basically, just more interesting than F-PC.  If you
        want to get a copy of this new Forth, it is available on internet.
        I have decided not to provide updates directly. You can find
        information on internet in the computer languages forth section.
        The Forth file is entitled WIN32FOR.ZIP.

        I hope the people that are using F-PC will continue to use it in
        the areas where it is appropriate, and will try the new windows
        Forth if they need it.  It has been enjoyable to have been part of
        the F-PC project, and I certainly thank all of you who contributed
        time, energy, code and money to myself and the community at large.

                                        Tom Zimmer
